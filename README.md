# A Beginner's Guide to SnowPack

Demo code to accompany our beginner's guide to Snowpack, a frontend build tool that's been getting a lot of attention in the community for its different approach when compared to tools like Webpack.

The code in this repo demonstrates how Snowpack functions as a module bundler both in development mode and (with the help of its Webpack plugin) how it can minify your code for production. 

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to start the dev server
4. Visit <http://localhost:8080/>
